## Placing Bets

### Step-by-Step

1. **Choose a Battle**
   - View active battles on the home screen
   - Spotlight battles are featured with higher visibility

2. **Select Checkpoint**
   - Pick which timeframe you want to bet on
   - Earlier checkpoints = faster results but less data

   - Choose which token you think will perform better
   - Review current metrics and trends

4. **Set Amount**
   - Minimum bet: $1 worth of $COC
   - No maximum limit

5. **Choose Leverage (Optional)**

   - 2x-50x = Multiplied potential returns
   - ⚠️ Higher leverage = higher risk

6. **Confirm Bet**
   - Review all details
   - Approve transaction
   - Wait for confirmation

### Leverage Explained

**Example with 10x leverage:**
- You bet: 100 $COC
- Token wins with 2x odds
